# üîê File Encryption CLI Tool (Go)

A simple and secure file encryption & decryption CLI tool built in Go. It uses **AES-256-GCM** encryption with **PBKDF2** for key derivation from a password.

---

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ AES-GCM encryption for confidentiality and integrity  
- üîë Password-based key derivation (PBKDF2 with salt/nonce)  
- üõ°Ô∏è Prevents double encryption and double decryption  
- üñ•Ô∏è Clean CLI interface with helpful log output  
- üîÑ Cross-platform compatible

üöÄ Getting Started
‚úÖ Prerequisites
Go installed (version 1.18 or higher)

üîß Build the Tool
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Encryption-With-Go.git
cd Encryption-With-Go
go build -o filecrypt-cli


üõ†Ô∏è Usage
üîí Encrypt a file
./filecrypt-cli encrypt /path/to/your/file.txt

You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password.

üîì Decrypt a file
./filecrypt-cli decrypt /path/to/your/file.txt
You will be prompted to enter the password.



üß™ Example
$ ./filecrypt-cli encrypt secret.txt
Enter Password:
Confirm Password:
[INFO] Encrypting...
[INFO] File successfully encrypted.

$ ./filecrypt-cli decrypt secret.txt
Enter Password:
[INFO] Decrypting...
[INFO] File successfully decrypted.


üîê How It Works
üîÑ Encryption Flow

graph TD
    A[Original File] --> B[Read File]
    B --> C[Generate Nonce]
    C --> D[Derive Key (PBKDF2)]
    D --> E[AES-GCM Seal]
    E --> F[Append Nonce to Ciphertext]
    F --> G[Overwrite File with Ciphertext]


üîì Decryption Flow
graph TD
    A[Encrypted File] --> B[Read File]
    B --> C[Extract Nonce]
    C --> D[Derive Key (PBKDF2)]
    D --> E[AES-GCM Open]
    E --> F[Write Plaintext Back to File]


‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
    Files are overwritten in-place (no backups created).

    Detects and blocks:

    Re-encryption of already encrypted files

    Re-decryption of already decrypted files

    Incorrect password causes decryption failure (no data leak).

    PBKDF2 with SHA-1 and 4096 iterations is used for key derivation.
